      <p>Last night we had to say goodbye to one of my oldest friends and closest companions. We brought Rosie home during
      Christmas break of my sophomore year of college, and she was one of the family for more than 14 years. I wish I had it
      in me to write a beautiful tribute, but words are beyond me today. I think that fact in and of itself conveys the level
      of grief in the Bodine and Simpson households right now. Rosie Posie lived a long, wonderful, happy life, but I am still
      going to miss her so very much. Please keep us in your thoughts, and hug your puppy close.</p>
